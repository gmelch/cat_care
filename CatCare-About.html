			<h3>Who Are We?</h3>
			<p>We are an innovative and advanced care facility equipped to take care of up to 50 animals at each of our three locations!  We can handle all ages and sizes of felines, ranging from small kittens to large wild cats.  Our team of animal-loving individuals committed to the well-being of our furry friends.  Every member of our team has their PACC (Professional Animal Care Certification).  Additionally, we have three locations (Memorial, Montrose, and Woodlands) so that you can leave your animal with whichever location is most convenient for you!</p1>

			<h3>Our Mission</h3>
			<p>We are devoted to taking outstanding care of your pets.  We know how much you love them, and we want to give them a gold standard of care.  That being said, we prioritize animal safety.  We do this by being extremely careful about animal interactions and only allowing your animal to interact with others if you approve.  After safety, we focus on the fun!  We want your feline to enjoy its stay at Cat Care.  We feature an "animal jungle" and a play pit in all of our care facilities!</p>
